# RBAC Fix: Removing Teams Dependency

## The Problem Ryan Identified

**Critical Issue:** The system was using `user['teams']` from JWT tokens for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), but we removed the teams tables. This would cause:

1. **Broken RBAC** - Privilege checks would fail
2. **Regression** - Previous user stories would break
3. **Security issues** - Users might not get proper access control

### Code That Was Broken:

```python
# In routers/task.py
user_teams = user.get("teams", [])  # ❌ This comes from JWT, which comes from database
task_reader.get_tasks_for_user(user_id, user_role, user_teams, user_departments)

# In utils/task_crud/read.py
if self._is_privileged_team(user_teams):  # ❌ Checking against teams that no longer exist
    return self._filter_tasks_by_departments(user_departments, include_archived)

# In utils/task_crud/update.py
def can_remove_assignees(self, user_role: str, user_teams: list) -> bool:
    if user_role in ASSIGNEE_REMOVAL_ROLES:
        return True
    return any(team in PRIVILEGED_TEAMS for team in user_teams)  # ❌ Checking removed teams
```

## The Solution

### 1. Remove `teams` from JWT Token

**File:** [backend/routers/auth.py](backend/routers/auth.py:21-29)

```python
# BEFORE
token = create_access_token({
    "sub": db_user["uuid"],
    "role": db_user["role"],
    "teams": db_user.get("teams", []),  # ❌ Removed
    "departments": db_user.get("departments", [])
})

# AFTER
token = create_access_token({
    "sub": db_user["uuid"],
    "role": db_user["role"],
    "departments": db_user.get("departments", [])  # ✅ Departments still used for director scope
})
```

### 2. Update Task Router to Remove user_teams

**File:** [backend/routers/task.py](backend/routers/task.py)

```python
# BEFORE
user_teams = user.get("teams", [])
task_reader.get_tasks_for_user(user_id, user_role, user_teams, user_departments)
task_updater.update_tasks(..., user_teams=user_teams, ...)

# AFTER
# No more user_teams!
task_reader.get_tasks_for_user(user_id, user_role, user_departments)
task_updater.update_tasks(..., ...)  # No user_teams parameter
```

### 3. Refactor TaskReader RBAC Logic

**File:** [backend/utils/task_crud/read.py](backend/utils/task_crud/read.py)

#### Method Signature Changes:

```python
# BEFORE
def get_tasks_for_user(self, user_id, user_role, user_teams, user_departments):
def _apply_access_control(self, user_id, user_role, user_teams, user_departments, include_archived):

# AFTER
def get_tasks_for_user(self, user_id, user_role, user_departments):
def _apply_access_control(self, user_id, user_role, user_departments, include_archived):
```

#### New Access Control Logic:

```python
def _apply_access_control(self, user_id, user_role, user_departments, include_archived=False):
    """
    Access control is now based purely on:
    - Role hierarchy (no more privileged teams check)
    - Project collaboration
    - Task assignment
    """
    # Managing directors see everything
    if user_role == MANAGING_DIRECTOR_ROLE:
        return self._get_all_tasks()

    # Directors see all tasks in their departments
    if user_role == DIRECTOR_ROLE:
        return self._filter_tasks_by_departments(user_departments, include_archived)

    # ✅ REMOVED: Privileged team check
    # if self._is_privileged_team(user_teams):
    #     return self._filter_tasks_by_departments(user_departments, include_archived)

    # Manager and staff see only their assigned tasks
    # (Managers have additional privileges for updating, but same read access)
    return self._filter_tasks_by_assignment(user_id, include_archived)
```

### 4. Refactor TaskUpdater to Remove Teams

**File:** [backend/utils/task_crud/update.py](backend/utils/task_crud/update.py)

```python
# BEFORE
def can_remove_assignees(self, user_role: str, user_teams: list) -> bool:
    if user_role in ASSIGNEE_REMOVAL_ROLES:
        return True
    return any(team in PRIVILEGED_TEAMS for team in user_teams)  # ❌ Checking removed teams

# AFTER
def can_remove_assignees(self, user_role: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if user can remove assignee IDs based on role.
    After removing the teams abstraction, this is now purely role-based.
    """
    return user_role.lower() in ASSIGNEE_REMOVAL_ROLES

# Method signature also updated
def update_tasks(self, main_task_id, user_id, user_role, ...):  # ✅ No user_teams parameter
```

### 5. Create Centralized RBAC Helper

**New File:** [backend/utils/rbac_helper.py](backend/utils/rbac_helper.py)

This provides reusable RBAC logic for the entire application:

```python
class RBACHelper:
    def has_privileged_role(self, user_role: str) -> bool:
        """Manager, director, or managing_director"""
        return user_role.lower() in PRIVILEGED_ROLES

    def can_remove_assignees(self, user_role: str) -> bool:
        """Manager, director, or managing_director"""
        return user_role.lower() in ASSIGNEE_REMOVAL_ROLES

    def get_user_projects(self, user_id: str, user_role: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get all projects accessible to the user"""
        # Managing directors see all
        # Directors see department projects
        # Staff/managers see only collaborator projects

    def can_access_project(self, user_id: str, user_role: str, project_id: str) -> bool:
        """Check if user can access a specific project"""
```

## New RBAC Model

### Access Control Hierarchy:

```
Managing Director
    └─> Access: ALL tasks across ALL departments
    └─> Can: Remove assignees, update any task

Director
    └─> Access: ALL tasks in THEIR departments
    └─> Can: Remove assignees, update department tasks

Manager
    └─> Access: Tasks where they are ASSIGNED
    └─> Can: Remove assignees (but only see assigned tasks)

Staff
    └─> Access: Tasks where they are ASSIGNED
    └─> Can: Update assigned tasks (but cannot remove assignees)
```

### Key Changes:

| Old System | New System |
|------------|------------|
| Privileged teams (sales manager, finance managers) got department-wide access | **Removed** - No special team privileges |
| Teams checked via `user['teams']` from JWT | **Removed** - No teams in JWT |
| `_is_privileged_team()` method | **Removed** - No privileged team logic |
| Access via team membership | Access via role + project collaboration |

### What Privileges Still Work:

✅ **Role-based privileges:**
- Managing directors: See all, modify all
- Directors: See all in department
- Managers: Can remove assignees (but only from their assigned tasks)
- Staff: Can only update (not remove assignees)

✅ **Project-based access:**
- Collaborators on a project can see tasks in that project
- Task assignees can see and update their assigned tasks

✅ **Department-based access:**
- Directors see all tasks where the owner is in their department

## Migration Impact

### Breaking Changes:

1. **Privileged Teams No Longer Work**
   - Old: Sales managers and finance managers had department-wide visibility
   - New: They only see assigned tasks (unless they're directors)
   - **Fix:** Promote these users to "manager" or "director" role if they need broad access

2. **JWT Tokens Changed**
   - Old: `{"sub": "...", "role": "...", "teams": [...], "departments": [...]}`
   - New: `{"sub": "...", "role": "...", "departments": [...]}`
   - **Impact:** Existing tokens will still work (teams field ignored), but new tokens won't have it

3. **API Signatures Changed**
   - `get_tasks_for_user()` no longer takes `user_teams`
   - `update_tasks()` no longer takes `user_teams`
   - **Impact:** Any external code calling these methods needs updates

### Non-Breaking Changes:

✅ **Still Works:**
- Role-based access (managing_director, director, manager, staff)
- Department-based access for directors
- Task assignment access for all users
- Assignee removal privileges for managers/directors

## Testing Checklist

After applying these fixes:

### RBAC Testing:

- [ ] **Managing Director**
  - Can see all tasks across all departments
  - Can remove assignees from any task
  - Can update any task

- [ ] **Director**
  - Can see all tasks in their department(s)
  - Can remove assignees from department tasks
  - Cannot see tasks outside their departments

- [ ] **Manager**
  - Can see only assigned tasks
  - Can remove assignees from assigned tasks
  - Cannot see unassigned tasks

- [ ] **Staff**
  - Can see only assigned tasks
  - Cannot remove assignees (can only add)
  - Cannot see unassigned tasks

### Regression Testing:

- [ ] Task reading works for all roles
- [ ] Task creation works
- [ ] Task updates work (with assignee changes)
- [ ] Archived tasks are accessible
- [ ] Date filtering works
- [ ] Project access control works
- [ ] No "teams" errors in logs

### JWT Testing:

- [ ] Login generates new token without `teams`
- [ ] Old tokens (with `teams`) still work
- [ ] Token includes `departments` field
- [ ] Role-based access works with new tokens

## SQL to Check for Orphaned Data

```sql
-- Check if any users still have teams field
SELECT uuid, email, teams
FROM users
WHERE teams IS NOT NULL AND array_length(teams, 1) > 0;

-- If you find users with teams, you may want to clear them:
-- UPDATE users SET teams = NULL WHERE teams IS NOT NULL;
```

## Ryan's Concerns Addressed

> "so what is returned from the jwt user['teams']"

**Answer:** Nothing anymore! We removed `teams` from the JWT token. Access control is now based on roles and project collaboration.

> "if the user is of a team like this, it will not even apply the rbac anymore"

**Fixed!** RBAC now works without teams. It's based on:
- Role hierarchy (managing_director > director > manager > staff)
- Project collaboration (collaborator_ids)
- Department membership (for directors)

> "how we going to prevent regression for the earlier user story"

**Prevention:**
1. Comprehensive testing checklist above
2. RBAC logic centralized in `rbac_helper.py`
3. Clear documentation of access control rules
4. Tests should be added for each role's access patterns

> "this rbac is it not supposed to be utilised for projects as well?"

**Yes!** The new `RBACHelper` class includes project access control:
- `get_user_projects()` - Get projects based on role and collaboration
- `can_access_project()` - Check if user can access a specific project
- Project visibility respects role hierarchy

## Next Steps

1. **Run all tests** to ensure RBAC works correctly
2. **Update any external code** that calls the modified methods
3. **Consider promoting** former privileged team members to manager/director roles
4. **Add automated tests** for RBAC scenarios
5. **Monitor logs** for any teams-related errors after deployment

**Ryan was absolutely right** - this was a critical issue that would have caused RBAC regression. Thank you for catching it! 🎯
